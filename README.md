## Problems
### Habitat shifts and loss of migratory birds due to climate change and environmental degradation
* Climate change has pushed breeding grounds up north.
* Migratory birds pass through the stop earlier.
* The habitats of migratory birds are gradually disappearing.
* Most migratory birds are becoming endangered species.

### Abnormal behavior of birds before a major disaster
* Abnormal behavior appears just before and after an earthquake.
* 15 minutes before the 2016 Oklahoma earthquake in the US, thousands of birds were spotted on radar as they covered the sky.
* Animals tended to show unusually active movements about 45 minutes before the earthquake was officially detected.

## UN-sustainable-development-goals(UN-SDGs)

**13. Climate Action**

* Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts

**15. Life on Land**

* Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss

## Solution
### LostBirds?
**Lost** : not knowing where you are or how to get to where you want to go, unable to find your way

**Lost Birds** : Let's make an application that can find birds lost due to environmental destruction and global warming!


### Concept
#### We want users to be able to tell if a migratory bird is lost or not through a photo of a migratory bird.
* First, use computer vision techniques to try to figure out what kind of bird it was.
* Second, by comparing the current position and time (season) information of the bird with the previous year's information, it is known how different the location was found.
* Lastly, we want to determine if migratory birds are too far away or exhibit abnormal behavior, and report this to the National Institute of Biological Resources.

### Feature
#### 1. You can see if migratory birds have not lost their way.

#### 2. More information on migratory birds can be found at the National Institute of Biological Resources.

## Goals & Expected Effects
### Use for research purposes
* In the existing research method of attaching a sensor to the foot of a migratory bird, it is expected to play a role as a device that can conduct sufficient research only with photos (videos) of migratory birds.
### Use for Educational Purposes
* It is expected that it will be used as a material to educate students about migratory birds in the learning field and the necessity of nature conservation and love for animals.

## Stacks
### Mobile application Frontend
React-Native + typescript for Android and iOS
