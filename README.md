# About-lostbirds
2023 Solution Challenge - Google Developers KUGODS LostBirds

## Problems
### Habitat shifts and loss of migratory birds due to climate change and environmental degradation
* Climate change has pushed breeding grounds up north.
* Migratory birds pass through the stop earlier.
* The habitats of migratory birds are gradually disappearing.
* Most migratory birds are becoming endangered species.

### Abnormal behavior of birds before a major disaster
* Abnormal behavior appears just before and after an earthquake.
* 15 minutes before the 2016 Oklahoma earthquake in the US, thousands of birds were spotted on radar as they covered the sky.
* Animals tended to show unusually active movements about 45 minutes before the earthquake was officially detected.

## UN-sustainable-development-goals(UN-SDGs)

**13. Climate Action**

* Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts

**15. Life on Land**

* Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss

## Solution
### LostBirds?
**Lost** : not knowing where you are or how to get to where you want to go, unable to find your way

**Lost Birds** : Let's make a mobile application that can find birds lost due to environmental destruction and global warming!
